# BirthdayWishes

This playful message board that was made as a way to share some joy in the form of virtual birthday cards.

Simply add a valid URL to a gif or image, give us a name for the recipient, a short personal message, and you can optionally include your own name on the card. Then hit submit and it will appear below if all fields were valid.

Afterwards, cards can be highlighted or deleted with the respective buttons on each individual card.
